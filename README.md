# PUZZLE SOLVER

A constraint satisfaction problem solver to solve the binary puzzle.

## The Algorithm

We used a backtracking algorithm variation: forward-checking and 
MAC(Maintaining arc consistency) with a heuristic (MRV: Minimum 
Remaining Values) to improve the solving speed.



## Constraints

•	Every row and column has an equal number of ones and zeros.

•	Numbers in each row and column should create a unique sequence.

•	Each row and column should not contain more than two same 
numbers in a row.


## Built With

* Python
* Javascript
* Eel library

Eel is a little Python library for making simple Electron-like offline 
HTML/JS GUI apps, with 
full access to Python capabilities and libraries.

In order to run the puzzle solver, you will need the library.
